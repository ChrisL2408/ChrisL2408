### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Christian and I'm an Economics, Computer Science & Entrepreneurship student at McGill University. I'm interested in front-end web development, product, venture capital and all things startups! In my free time, I actively train and compete in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and have been training for around 4 years!

## Experience
- Hack4Impact McGill ðŸŒŽ: Project Manager (September 23' - Present)
- Front Row Ventures ðŸ“ˆ: Director of Investments (May 23' - Present)
- Inovia Capital ðŸ§ : VC Summer Investment Analyst (May 23' - Aug 23')
- Growth/Biz Dev/Product at Multiple Startups from EdTech to Decentralised Finance!

## What I'm currently up to
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal website that allows me to track my BJJ Competition Results/Stats and upload my competition highlights.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m re-learning Javascript & React and brushing up on my front-end development skills to help me build Web Apps for personal project MVPs.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been in the venture capital (VC) space for around 2 years investing with funds at the early stage such as Front Row Ventures & Inovia Capital. I have a podcast on how I broke into VC if you are interested to listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQECInxJV0w
